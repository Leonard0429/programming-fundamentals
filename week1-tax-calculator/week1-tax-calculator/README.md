# Week 1 – Tax Calculator 💰

This is my programming assignment for calculating income tax based on a user-entered tax rate and multiple income values.

## 📌 What it does:
- Asks the user to input a tax rate
- Repeatedly asks the user to enter income amounts
- Calculates tax for each income using the `calculate_tax` function
- Shows total tax using the `total_tax` function

## 🧪 Example Output

Enter tax rate (as a decimal, e.g., 0.20 for 20%): 0.10
Enter income amount (or type 'done' to finish): 5000
Tax for this income: 500.0 SGD
Enter income amount (or type 'done' to finish): 3000
Tax for this income: 300.0 SGD
Enter income amount (or type 'done' to finish): done
Total owed income tax is: 800.0 SGD
