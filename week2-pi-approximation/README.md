# Week 2 – Pi Approximation using Series 🔢

This is my Week 2 assignment for Programming Fundamentals at Republic Polytechnic. The task is to approximate the value of **π (pi)** using a mathematical series.

## 📌 Task Objective

- Use **two functions**:
  - `calcTerm(denominator)`: Calculates one term in the series.
  - `calcPi(x)`: Calculates the approximation of pi using x terms.

- The program uses the **Leibniz formula**:
  π ≈ 4/1 - 4/3 + 4/5 - 4/7 + 4/9 - ...
  
- The user enters how many terms to use for the approximation.

## 🧪 Sample Output
Enter how many terms to use to approximate pi (must be at least 1): 5
Approximation of pi using 5 terms is: 3.3396825396825403
