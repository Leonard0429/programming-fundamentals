# Week 5 – Coordinate Checker 📍

This program checks whether a 2D coordinate `(x, y)` is inside or outside a predefined box.

## 📌 Task Description

- A function called `checkCoord(x, y)` determines if the coordinate is inside or outside the box.
- The box boundaries are defined as:
  - X: between 100 and 250
  - Y: between 120 and 220
- The user enters the x and y coordinates.

## 🧪 Sample Output
Enter coordinates x: 150
Enter coordinates y: 130
True, coordinate is inside of the box
For ( 150 , 130 )

## 📝 Notes

- The function uses logical conditions to check boundary inclusion.
- The function prints the result instead of returning True/False.
- The main program prints the coordinate afterward.
